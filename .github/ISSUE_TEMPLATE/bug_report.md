* Please search existing issues before raising a new issue. For questions about
  Basestation3 or for help using Basestation3, or any sort of "how do I?"
  requests, contact iopsg AT uw DOT edu.

* In your issue, please include a clear and concise description of what the bug
  is, the expected output, and how to replicate it.  Please include the log
  output (e.g., from baselog.log or glider_early_gps.log) or netCDF file that 
  shows the output of the basestation demonstrating the bug.
  
* If the issue involves a processing problem or error, please include any files
  needed to replicate the bug.  At a minimum, that should be the 
  sg_calib_constants.m, comm.log, any input files (ideally the \*.x\* files 
  transmitted from the Seaglider to the basestation server for the dives
  in question). If available, please include the capture file from the most 
  recent selftest (pt\*.cap). 
  
  
* Please include a brief description of the Seaglider that generated the input
  files (glider serial number, RevB or RevE, Seaglider firmware revision and
  payload description at minimum).
  
* Remove all placeholder text above before submitting.
