# protections adds additional restrictions to who can access certain API
# endpoints. By default only the /save endpoint is protected - it is only
# available in private and pilot run modes. Format:
#
# url: { mode:[pilot,private,public], groups:[group1, group2, ...], users:[user1user2] }
#
# There are two typical use cases for these types of control 
#   - to change the run modes under which certain endpoints can be 
#     accessed (i.e., to prevent all access to selftest, raw file, or 
#     download endpoints when running as a public server)
#   - to give only a certain group of users access to these endpoints,
#     independently of the per mission controls. A "download" user could
#     be created and raw data API endpoints could be restricted to that
#     user, or only users in a "downloads" group 
#
# Protections are checked first at the endpoint level and then at the
# the mission level. All checks must pass (a user or user's assigned groups
# must be appropriately credentialed at both endpoint and mission levels
# if both are specified)
#
# Endpoints /auth, /GLIDERNUM, and /, cannot be protected in this
# way. Protected missions and gliders will not be available on those
# pages of course, but the assumption is that those pages will always
# be available if only to provide a login page.
#
# default values, specified with the defaults: key, will
# be applied to all protectable endpoints, whether or not
# they are specified herein.
# 
# To create a completely protected site, add a groups to defaults here
# and in defaults under missions.
# 
endpoints:
 defaults: { groups:[basic] }
 selftest: { modes:[pilot,private], groups:[pilots] }


# 4 sets of defaults can be specified: defaults (fallback)
# privatedefaltis, pilotdefaults, and publicdefaults corresponding to
# the different run modes. If a value is specified for a mission it
# is always used, else use values from run mode specific defaults,
# else use any values specified in defaults. Values not specified
# anywhere will be left empty - no defaults are provided in the code. 
missions:
# defaults applied to all missions if not elsewhere spec'd
 defaults: { link: http://iop.apl.washington.edu }
# defaults applied to all missions when running in pilot mode
 pilotdefaults: { pilotgroups: [analysts] }
# now the actual missions
