# This configuration file is used by MakeMissionTimeSeries and MakeMissionProfile
# (or Base.p/Reprocess.py when generating whole mission products) to add, delete or
# change data types included in the whole mission files.  Use the --whole_mission_config
# option for any of the above files with a version of this file as the argument.
#
# The format is of two dictionaries (either is optional) for the whole mission timeseries and
# whole mission profile netcdf files.  Each dictionary is a series of variable names and
# the action/type pairs. The action/type value may be one of:
#
#    True - include the variable
#    False - do not include the variable
#    type - include the variable, using the specified type string as the type to write to the
#           netcdf file (possibly changing the default type for the variable).
#
# Accepted types are:
# S1 or c (NC_CHAR)
# i1 or b or B (NC_BYTE)
# u1 (NC_UBYTE)
# i2 or h or s (NC_SHORT)
# u2 (NC_USHORT)
# i4 or i or l (NC_INT)
# u4 (NC_UINT)
# i8 (NC_INT64)
# u8 (NC_UINT64)
# f4 or f (NC_FLOAT)
# f8 or d (NC_DOUBLE)
#
# Note: Not all type conversions may not always work - testing is advised.
#
# A full listing of the all known variables and default values can be obtained by:
#   python MakeMissionTimeSeries.py --dump_whole_mission_config
# or
#   python MakeMissionProfile.py --dump_whole_mission_config
#
# Note: The names are as they appear in netCDF files, and may not correspond to variable names
# as they appear in the source files.
#
# Below is some example settings.

  # Change default type to be float64
