# .pagers file
#
# A global copy of this file may be place in

# /usr/local/basestation3/etc/.pagers
#
# If --group_etc is specified on the Base.py command line, then a that directory will
# also be searched for a version of this file
#
# This file controls the sending of short email messages from the basestation
# that alert users (pilots, field teams, etc.) of changes in status of the glider
#
# Each line of this file is of the format
# smtp_mail_address,[html,]pager_tag[,pager_tag*]
#
# where:
#
# smtp_mail_address - a valid smtp mail address - gliderpilot@apl.washington.edu
#                     for example
#
# html       - send the email in html format, instead of plain text
#
# slack      - treat the smtp_mail_address as a slack/mattermost webhook and post message using the hook
#
# and pager_tag is one of the below
#
# gps        - GPS position notification - sent as soon a GPS message appears in the comm.log
#              Short message - suitable for mail to SMS gateways
#              GPS fix formatted in DDMM.MM format
#
# lategps    - same as GPS message, but sent at the conclusion of data processing
#
# recov      - Notification of the glider in recovery (whatever the reason) 
#              Short message - suitable for mail to SMS gateways
#              GPS fix formatted in DDMM.MM format
# 
# critical   - Notification of the glider:
#              - Is in a non-quit recovery
#              - Has rebooted
#              - Has uploaded capture file with one or more critical errors
#              Short message - suitable for mail to SMS gateways
#              GPS fix formatted in DDMM.MM format
#
# drift      - Generates an estimate of the current drift of the glider and an estimate
#              of future positions.  Requires at least 5 GPS fixes from the same dive
#
#
# gpsdd|lategpsdd|driftdd|recovdd|criticaldd                     - same as above but GPS fix formated in DD.DDDD format
# gpsddmm|lategpsddmm|driftddmm|recovddmm|criticalddmm           - same as above but GPS fix formated in DD MM.MM format
# gpsddmmss|lategpsddmmss|driftddmmss|recovddmmss|criticalddmmss - same as above but GPS fix formated in DD MM SS.SS format
#
# alerts     - Notifications of
#              -- Any problems or issues that occurred during basestation processing
#              -- Non-critical, but important conditions the glider has encounted, such as a $WARN message
#                   in the Seaglider logfile.
#              -- Notification of capture files that contain critical errors
#              Pilots should always subscribe to the level, as it is the primary way for
#              basestation to issue errors
#
# comp       - Notification of completion of processing and a list of files resulting from 
#              processing
#
# divetar    - Notification of all dive tarball files generated - see --divetarballs option to Base.py
#
# errors     - A list of all the warning, error and critical messages generated during conversion processing
#
## Examples:
#
## Send me everything
#someone@mydomain.edu,gps,alerts,recov,comp
#
## Setting up a field phone for gps updates only
#fieldphone@mobile.att.net,gps
