## .pagers file 
#
# This file controls the sending of short email messages from the basestation
# that alert users (pilots, field teams, etc.) of changes in status of the glider
#
# Each line of this file is of the format
# smtp_mail_address[,gps[dd|ddmm|ddmmss]|alerts|recov|comp]*
#
# where:
# smtp_mail_address - a valid smtp mail address - gliderpilot@apl.washington.edu
#                     for example
#
# gps        - GPS position notification 
#              Short message - suitable for mail to SMS gateways
#              GPS fix formatted in DDMM.MM format
#
# recov      - Notification of the glider in recovery (whatever the reason) 
#              Short message - suitable for mail to SMS gateways
#              GPS fix formatted in DDMM.MM format
# 
# critical   - Notification of the glider:
#              - Is in a non-quit recovery
#              - Has rebooted
#              - Has uploaded capture file with one or more critical errors
#              Short message - suitable for mail to SMS gateways
#              GPS fix formatted in DDMM.MM format
#
# gpsdd|recovdd|criticaldd             - same as above but GPS fix formated in DD.DDDD format
# gpsddmm|recovddmm|criticalddmm       - same as above but GPS fix formated in DD MM.MM format
# gpsddmmss|recovddmmss|criticalddmmss - same as above but GPS fix formated in DD MM SS.SS format
#
# Any of the above forms of gps, recov and critical may have a _divenum appended to augment which adds
# the dive number, call cycle and calls made counts to the subject line and message body
#
#
# alerts     - Notifications of
#              -- Any problems or issues that occurred during basestation processing
#              -- Non-critical, but important conditions the glider has encounted, such as a $WARN message
#                   in the Seaglider logfile.
#              -- Notification of capture files that contain critical errors
#              Pilots should always subscribe to the level, as it is the primary way for
#              basestation to issue errors

#
# comp       - Notification of completion of processing and a list of files resulting from 
#              processing
#
## Examples:
#
## Send me everything
#someone@mydomain.edu,gps,alerts,recov,comp
#
## Setting up a field phone for gps updates only
#fieldphone@mobile.att.net,gps
