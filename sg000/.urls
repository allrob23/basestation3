## These are URLs to GET for each processed dive
##
## A global copy of this file may be place in
##
## /usr/local/basestation3/etc/.extensions
##
## That file will be processed first, the one in the seaglider home directory second.
##
## The urls are called twice during processing - the first time, after all the per-dive files have been 
## processed - in which case Base.py adds the arguments 
##
## 'instrument_name=sg<xxx>&dive=<dive>&files=perdive'
##
## The second time is at the end of processing, after  all the whole mission files have been generated, 
## in which case Base.py add the arguments:
##
## 'instrument_name=sg<xxx>&dive=<dive>&files=all'
##
## First entry on the line is the timeout to wait for a response to the GET
## It is separated by a whitespace from the URL
## The third argument is a cert chain (PEM format) for the website.  This can be obtained either by:
##
## openssl s_client -showcerts -connect iop.apl.washington.edu:443
##
## Or via a browser (firefox seems to have the best support as of version 104.0.2)
##
## Comments in the file are indicated by '#'

## Example
