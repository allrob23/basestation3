## These are URLs to GET for each processed dive
##
## The urls are called twice during processing - the first time, after all the per-dive files have been 
## processed - in which case Base.py adds the arguments 
##
## 'instrument_name=sg<xxx>&dive=<dive>&files=perdive'
##
## The second time is at the end of processing, after  all the whole mission files have been generated, 
## in which case Base.py add the arguments:
##
## 'instrument_name=sg<xxx>&dive=<dive>&files=all'
##
## First entry on the line is the timeout to wait for a response to the GET
## It is separated by a whitespace from the URL
## Comments in the file are indicated by '#'
##
## Example
#1   http://mydomain.edu/~glider/cgi-bin/update.cgi
